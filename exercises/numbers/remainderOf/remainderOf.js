/**
 * Given two positive, `n` and `d`, returns the remainder of `n` after

 * insight into how the modulo operator works.
 *
 * @example
 * remainderOf(10, 1); // => 0
 * remainderOf(10, 2); // => 0
 * remainderOf(10, 3); // => 1
 * remainderOf(10, 4); // => 2
 * remainderOf(129, 17); // => 10
 *
 * @param {number} num The input number
 * @returns {boolean} True if num is even and false otherwise
